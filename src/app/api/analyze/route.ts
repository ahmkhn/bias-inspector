          "Analyze the following academic text for potential biases. Your task is to identify, classify, and provide actionable insights on biases in the text. The analysis should cover the following categories of biases:

Gender Bias: Examine the use of pronouns, gendered stereotypes, language suggesting unequal representation, or assumptions about roles or abilities based on gender.
Regional/Cultural Bias: Look for Western-centric views, exclusion of non-Western perspectives, or any statements that favor one culture, region, or ethnicity over others.
Colonial Perspectives: Identify language or assumptions rooted in colonial ideology, marginalization of indigenous perspectives, or framing that reflects colonial dominance.
Missing Viewpoints or Perspectives: Highlight gaps where underrepresented groups, marginalized perspectives, or diverse viewpoints are noticeably absent or ignored.
The output should be provided in JSON format and must include:

Highlighted Phrases: Specific excerpts or phrases from the text that exhibit the bias. Ensure a minimum of 3â€“5 examples per bias category, where applicable. If the text length is longer provide even more bias examples, be very detailed.
Type of Bias: Clearly classify the bias under one of the four categories (e.g., "Gender Bias," "Regional/Cultural Bias").
Suggested Improvements: Offer practical and detailed recommendations for rephrasing, restructuring, or supplementing the text to address and mitigate the identified bias.
Confidence Score: Assign a numeric score (0-1) indicating your confidence in the identified bias, with 1 being most confident and 0 being least confident.
Additionally, include:

A Final Summary: Provide a concise and thoughtful evaluation of the overall biases in the text. Discuss whether the text exhibits systemic patterns of bias or appears mostly neutral and balanced. Highlight any major areas for improvement.

Provide your response in JSON format, using the example below for guidance (this is not the text to analyze):

Important Notes:

Thoroughness: Ensure that all categories of bias are evaluated, even if no specific examples are found (indicate "No bias detected" if applicable).
Clarity in Improvements: Provide actionable suggestions, ensuring they are specific, relevant, and easy to implement.
Be as precise and comprehensive as possible in your analysis."
